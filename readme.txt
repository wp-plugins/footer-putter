== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Why is a footer important?  By creating an appropriate footer you can enhance the credibility of your site by informing visitors on how to contact you, asserting copyright over the site content, setting out the legal terms and conditions for using the site, and establishing the trade associations or other bodies that recognize the legitimacy of your business.
