* Create a footer that gives your site the credibility that it belongs to a real business
* Include a footer menu with links to Contact, Privacy and Terms and Conditions Pages

* The Footer hook setting allows you to add the footer in just the right place on themes that do not have suitable widget areas 
* Ensures all links in the footer widgets are rel=nofollow in line with best SEO recommendations

== Installation ==

* Install Footer Putter either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the zip file to your server

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Why is a footer important?  By creating an appropriate footer you can enhance the credibility of your site by informing visitors on how to contact you, asserting copyright over the site content, setting out the legal terms and conditions for using the site, and establishing the trade associations or other bodies that recognize the legitimacy of your business.

* Why use rel=nofollow links?  Links in the footer appear on every page on the site so you want to tell the search engines not to follow these links. After all, just because every page on the site may link to the "About Us", "Contact Us", "Terms of Service",  and "Privacy Policy" pages doesn't mean you want these to be the top ranking pages on your site after the home page.
